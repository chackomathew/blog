= JDBC
Intro
JDBC is an api which defines how client may access the database. Provides methods to query, update data in database.It uses JDBC drivers to connect with the database. Current version 4.2 MR release in Java 1.8.

`api: application program interface is code that allows two applications to communicate with each other. It tells developers how to make requests/calls to OS/other applications. Typically APIs are released for third-party developement as part of SDKs`

The JDBC classes are contained in the Java package, java.sql and javax.sql

Architecture
JDBC API - Program to JDBC Manager connenction - which we'll be using to code
JDBC Driver API - JDBC Manager to driver connection - specific for database vendors like Oracle, MySql etc

JDBC Driver - implements JDBC interfaces (comes with standard Java) targetting a particular database
*JDBC-ODBC Bridge driver
*Native Api driver
*Network protocol driver

= AWS
.*Elastic Computing*
- avoid overprovisioning and scale up for the needs

.*Global Infrastructure*
* region - geographical area us-east, es-west
* availability zone - data center, within a particular region
* edge locations - doesn't have aws resources, but have some services eg: dns, cloudfront

.*Shared Security Responsibility*
* AWS responsibility - host, storage, network, datacenter security
* Our Reponsibility - AWS account security

.*Ephemeral Storage*
- instance store
- temporary block-level storage hosted on the same server as EC2
- free
- data lost when instance stopped or terminated

.*S3*
- internet accessible
- unlimited bucket size
- upto 5TB object size
- price for storage used and transfer out
- not a file system
* 99.99% SLA - uptime
.*Standard Storage* 99.99999999% durability(say u have 10k objects, u'll lose 1 object in 1 million years :):D)
- replicated mutliple times in the same availability zone and then replicated across availability zone in the region. sustain upto two availability zones failures
.*Reduced Redundancy Storage*
- 99.99% 10k, 1 will fail per year
- cheaper


.*Identity and Access Managament IAM*
- user and service management
- control access to AWS resources
- MFA
- API access

.*Elastic Compute Cloud EC2*
- scalable plaforms for VMs
- windows/linux instances
- based of AMI Amazon Machine Image - template/configuration to deploy a VM
- ECU - measure the CPU usage. 1ECU - 1.2GHz 2007 Intel Opteron or 2007 Xeon. AWS moved to vCPU (share of the physical CPU assigned to a VM)
- https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/ instance types based on workload - general purpose, compute optimized, memory optimized, storage optimized, GPU instances
- https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/ On-demand instances - pay per hour for the compute capacity used
- Reserved Instances less expensive, but needs commitment(1 or 3 year)

.*Elastic Block Store*


.*VPC*
- logically isolated network in AWS. to isolate from other tenants.
- ingress and egress(inbound and outbound)
- vpc peering - internetwork w/ other vpc
- elastic ip
- enable hybrid cloud(site to site vpn)
- free
- vpn - 0.05/hr
- additional networking layer between AWS resources and infrastructure
- Access - Gateway(Internet Gateway,CG) or VPN(Direct Connect, Hardware VPN)

VPC Peering
-connect to other vpc network within same region
-ip address scheme should not overlap
-no transitive peering

Access Control List

Security Groups
-resource level traffic firewall for all IaaS AWS components such as EC2, ELB, etc. 
-ingress and egress. You can add rules to control inbound traffic to instances and seperate rules to controll outbound traffic. Rules are used to allow not deny, so by default all inbound traffic is denied and all outbound traffic is allowed. 
-vpc comes with a default security group. sec grp not mentioned = def sec grp
